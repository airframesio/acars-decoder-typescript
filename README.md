# acars-decoder-typescript

ACARS is an aircraft communications messaging protocol that has been in use worldwide for a few decades. This library exists to specifically decode the text portion of the ACARS message payload.

The library is built around research and discoveries from the [ACARS Message Documentation](https://github.com/airframesio/acars-message-documentation), a community effort to document the details of the ACARS message label/text payload.

It has been written in TypeScript (which compiles to Javascript) and is published as an NPM package.

You are welcome to contribute (please see https://github.com/airframesio/acars-message-documentation where we collaborate to research and document the various types of messages), and while it was primarily developed to power Airframes, you may use this library in your own applications freely.
