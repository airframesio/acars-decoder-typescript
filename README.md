ACARS is an aircraft communications messaging protocol that has been in use worldwide for a few decades. This library exists to specifically decode the text portion of the ACARS message payload.

The library is built around research and discoveries from the [ACARS Message Documentation](https://github.com/airframesio/acars-message-documentation), a community effort to document the details of the ACARS message label/text payload.

It has been written in TypeScript (which compiles to Javascript) and is published as an NPM package.

You are welcome to contribute (please see https://github.com/airframesio/acars-message-documentation where we collaborate to research and document the various types of messages), and while it was primarily developed to power [Airframes](https://app.airframes.io) and [AcarsHub](https://sdr-e.com/docker-acarshub), you may use this library in your own applications freely.
